Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter type of objects that will be created.


Factory Method is used when

1. We Want to move the object creation logic from our code to a separate class

2. We use this pattern when we do not know in advance which class we may need to instantiate
beforehand & also to allow new classes to be added to system and handle their creation without affecting client code

3. We let subclasses decide which object to instantiate  by overriding the factory method
